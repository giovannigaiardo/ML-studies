# Machine learning studies

This repository contains some of the machine learning programs I have developed during my studies.

I have analised the following datasets so far:
- Iris Data Set;
- Wine Data Set;
- Glass Identification Data Set;
- Sales_Transactions_Dataset_Weekly Data Set.

I have used techniques like clusterizing and MLP Artificial Neural Networks.
